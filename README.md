C++ codes and concepts

make changes in readme file for experimenting with branches like creation,deletion or updation.

I have changed this file locally and committed those changes. Now I have to pull from remote before pushing these commits because the remote already contains some
updates since the last time I forked it. If remote contains changes in this particular file, then pulling will replace the commits(not pushed yet) that we have made 
locally with the commit of remote(during main|merging). That means we lose the changes that we were going to push before pulling.
